### MTA Subway Data Analysis And Application

For the first project at Metis data science bootcamp, we looked into[New York subway data(http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and [census data on demographics by zipcode](http://zipatlas.com/). Baseed on the findings, we made recommendations for a nonprofit organization WomenTechWomenYes on whcih subway stations to place street teams in early summer to optimize their fund raising efforts.

Our strategy was to find the 20 busiest stations and then use demographic information in the zipcode where each station is located to decide which ones are likely the best choices among them.

The factors that we took into consideration in gauging the likelihood of someone willing to donate to this cause include:
* median household income
* gender ratio
* education level
* percentage of population that commute

Based on these criteria, we recommend a few subway stations for initial test run. With feedback loop, we'll refine our algorithm and make better decisions in the future.
